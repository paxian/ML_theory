ROSE VS JACK, OR FEMALE VS MALE
====================================

How many people in your training set survived the disaster with the Titanic? To see this, you can use the table() command in combination with the $-operator to select a single column of a data frame:
# absolute numbers
table(train$Survived)
# percentages
prop.table(table(train$Survived))
Run these commands in the console, and see that 549 individuals died (62%) and 342 survived (38%). So one possible prediction heuristic would be "majority wins", resulting in "everybody dies" here.
In general, the table() command can help you to explore what variables have predictive value. For example, maybe gender could play a role as well to get your seat on the lifeboat? You can explore this using the table() function for a two-way comparison on the number of males and females that survived:
table(<data_variable_1>, <data_variable_2>)
If you want to calculate proportions, by wrapping a prop.table() function around table() as before, you'll need to specify whether you want row-wise or column-wise proportions:
# row-wise proportions
prop.table(table(<var_1>, <var_2>),1)
# column-wise proportions
prop.table(table(<var_1>, <var_2>),2)
Instructions

Calculate the survival rates in absolute numbers and proportions using table() and prop.table() on the train data frame.
Next, do a two-way comparison on the number of males and females that survived (both in absolute numbers and in row-wise proportions).
