A Random Forest analysis in R

0 XP
For a Random Forest analysis in R you make use of the randomForest() function in the randomForest package. You call the function in a similar way as rpart():
First your provide the formula. There is no argument class here to inform the function you're dealing with predicting a categorical variable, so you need to turn Survived into a factor with two levels: as.factor(Survived) ~ Pclass + Sex + Age
The data argument takes the train data frame.
When you put the importance argument to TRUE you can inspect variable importance.
The ntree argument specifies the number of trees to grow. Limit these when having only limited computational power at your disposal.
To end, since Random Forest uses randomization, you set a seed like this set.seed(111) to assure reproducibility of your results. Once the model is constructed, you can use the prediction function predict().
Instructions

Perform a Random Forest and name the model my_forest. Use the variables Passenger Class, Sex, Age, Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard, Number of Parents/Children Aboard, Passenger Fare, Port of Embarkation, and Title (in this order).
Set the number of trees to grow to 1000 and make sure you can inspect variable importance.
Make a prediction (my_prediction) on the test set using the predict() function.
Create a data frame my_solution that contains the solution in line with the Kaggle standards.
Turn your solution into a csv file with the name my_solution.csv.
