DOES AGE PLAY A ROLE?
==========================

Another variable that could influence survival is age: it's probable children were saved first. You can test this by creating a new column with a categorical variable child. child will take the value 1 in case age is <18, and a value of 0 in case age is >=18.
To add this new variable you need to do two things (i) create a new column, and (ii) provide the values for each observation (i.e., row) based on the age of the passenger.
Adding a new column with R is easy and can be done via the $-operator. For example,
train$new <- 10
would create a new column in the train data frame with the value 10 for each observation.
To set the values based on the age of the passenger, you make use of a boolean test inside the square bracket operator. With the []-operator you create a subset of rows and assign a value to a certain variable of that subset of observations. For example,
train$new[train$Survived == 1] <- 0
would give a value of 0 to the variable new for the subset of passengers that survived the disaster.
Instructions

Create a new column Child in the train data frame that takes the value NA, if the passenger's age is NA, 1 when the passenger is < 18 years and the value 0 when the passenger is >= 18 years.
Do a two-way comparison on the number of children vs adults that survived, in row-wise proportions. Your answer should look like this (rows relate to Child, and column to Survived).
